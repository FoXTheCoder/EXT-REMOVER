Disabling School Extension - Step-by-Step Guide

If you're looking to temporarily disable a specific school extension on your Chromebook, follow these steps:

1.Open the Manifest File:
   - Open your Chrome browser on the Chromebook.
   - In the address bar, enter the following URL:
     chrome-extension://gndmhdcefbhlchkhipcnnbkcmicncehk/manifest.json
   - This URL will open the manifest file of the extension you're targeting.

2.Access the Developer Tools:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (or `Cmd + Option + I` on Mac) to open the Developer Tools.
   - Alternatively, right-click on the page and select "Inspect."

3.Navigate to the Console Tab:
   - Within the Developer Tools, navigate to the "Console" tab. This is where you can input and execute commands.

4.Run the Disable Command:
   - In the console, enter the following code:
     javascript
     chrome.management.setEnabled('extensionid', false);
   - Replace 'extensionid' with the actual ID of the extension you want to disable.
   - You can find the extension's ID by opening the extension details page in `chrome://extensions` and copying the ID from the URL after the `=` sign.

5. Execute the Command:
   - Press `Enter` to execute the command. The specified extension should now be disabled.

Remember that this method only temporarily disables the extension. The extension will become active again when you restart your Chromebook or refresh the extensions.

Note:Always use this knowledge responsibly and in appropriate environments. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to modify extensions.
